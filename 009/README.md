log system which is interactable

## Description
refer to python logging  
offers several categories of components: loggers, handlers, filters, and formatters.  
* Loggers expose the interface that application code directly uses.
* Handlers send the log records (created by loggers) to the appropriate destination.
* Filters provide a finer grained facility for determining which log records to output.
* ~~Formatters specify the layout of log records in the final output.(not necessary here, we don't need change the format)~~
